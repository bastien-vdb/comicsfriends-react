                                In the past comic book, artists have often been overlooked in the world of art or they havenâ€™t 
                                been given the due credit that they deserve. Artists have struggled with obtaining rights and

                                Comic book art is often seen as less important than other arts in the eyes of many, which is
                                why Comics Friends wants to spotlight all these incredible artists and their work. Although
                                there are already several comic book museums around the world and comic book conferences,
                                there is no place where all comic book and artwork lovers and artists can come together
                                online and display their work...
